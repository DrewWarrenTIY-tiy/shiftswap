Synopsis

This project creates a web app for scheduling shift workers in any industry. Uses ReactJS on the front-end for fast performance and implements Firebase on the back-end to store user data and schedules.

Motivation

After working in several industries and hearing complaints from managers about changes to the schedule and finding people to cover your shifts easily, I have decided to try to address these concerns in a way that will be easy to implement.
