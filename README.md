Synopsis

This project should create a web app for scheduling shift workers in any industry. Will use ReactJS and Firebase.

Motivation

After working in several industries and hearing complaints from managers about changes to the schedule and finding people to cover your shifts easily, I have decided to try to address these concerns in a way that will be easy to implement.
